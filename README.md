# ecurvechat
An Elliptic-Curve Based Secure Chat, written using Rust and Protobuf!

Note: this is an educational project I did to learn more about crypto, and should not be used for serious communications.
I've also written a [post](https://vaktibabat.github.io/posts/ecurvechat/) describing how all the crypto concepts used, and how I've implemented them.
